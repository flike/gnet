## ðŸ“– Introduction

`gnet` is an event-driven networking framework that is fast and lightweight. It makes direct [epoll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoll) and [kqueue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kqueue) syscalls rather than using the standard Go [net](https://golang.org/pkg/net/) package and works in a similar manner as [netty](https://github.com/netty/netty) and [libuv](https://github.com/libuv/libuv), which makes `gnet` achieve a much higher performance than Go [net](https://golang.org/pkg/net/).

`gnet` is not designed to displace the standard Go [net](https://golang.org/pkg/net/) package, but to create a networking server framework for Go that performs on par with [Redis](http://redis.io) and [Haproxy](http://www.haproxy.org) for networking packets handling.

`gnet` sells itself as a high-performance, lightweight, non-blocking, event-driven networking framework written in pure Go which works on transport layer with TCP/UDP protocols and Unix Domain Socket , so it allows developers to implement their own protocols(HTTP, RPC, WebSocket, Redis, etc.) of application layer upon `gnet` for building  diversified network applications, for instance, you get an HTTP Server or Web Framework if you implement HTTP protocol upon `gnet` while you have a Redis Server done with the implementation of Redis protocol upon `gnet` and so on.

**`gnet` derives from the project: `evio` while having a much higher performance and more features.**
